# Product Mission

## Pitch
Reactive Knowledge Agent is an AI knowledge automation platform that helps corporate teams
turn documentation into verified facts and execute tasks by providing grounded retrieval,
intent clarification, and safe actioning.

## Users

### Primary Customers
- Engineering organizations: Need fast, reliable answers from internal docs to ship code.
- Knowledge management teams: Maintain trusted, up-to-date internal knowledge bases.

### User Personas
**Alex** (30-45)
- **Role:** Staff engineer on a platform team
- **Context:** Supports multiple product squads with shared tooling and docs
- **Pain Points:** Stale documentation, repeated questions, and unclear ownership of facts
- **Goals:** Reliable answers, fewer interruptions, and faster onboarding

## The Problem

### Fragmented, Stale Knowledge
Corporate documentation changes quickly and lives in many places, causing teams to waste
time finding answers and to make decisions based on outdated facts. This slows delivery
and increases rework.

**Our Solution:** Continuously ingest documentation, normalize it into facts, resolve
conflicts, and use those facts to answer questions and execute tasks.

## Differentiators

### Verified Facts With Conflict Resolution
Unlike generic chatbots, we store structured facts with provenance and resolve conflicts
as new information arrives. This results in higher trust and fewer incorrect actions.

## Key Features

### Core Features
- **Intent clarification:** Distinguish new information from retrieval requests and
  confirm updates before changing stored facts.
- **Knowledge ingestion:** Transform documents into structured, retrievable facts.
- **Grounded retrieval:** Answer requests using verified facts with context.

### Collaboration Features
- **Shared knowledge workspace:** Centralized knowledge base for teams and departments.
- **Access control and audit trail:** Track changes and enforce ownership of facts.

### Advanced Features
- **Conflict resolution:** Detect and reconcile contradictory information over time.
- **Domain learning packs:** Learn new programming languages or domains from curated docs.
